			<h3>Bio</h3>
			I'm a computer science student at Concordia University graduating in December 2024. I currently play on the Men's soccer team
			at Concordia and enjoying staying active. I started University as a Math and Computational Finance student, but I loved my first
			programing course so much that I decided to switch into Computer Science and haven't looked back since. I love to program
			and learn new technologies. I'm interested in a wide range of topics in CS: web development, cyber security and application
			development to name a few. This summer I hope to work for a company that will allow to grow as a programmer and as a person.
